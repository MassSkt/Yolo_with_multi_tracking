# keras yolo3 with object detection

## Introduction

keras Yolo with open cv multi tracking.
This implementation enables us to smoothing yolo detection with open-cv tracking.

Tracking bounding box is initialized with yolo detection bounding box which is averaged with tracking prediction using previous frame.

## Note

Test code 'Yolo.ipynb' can be run by jupyter notebook
